MakeTrack
=========

A game for Oulu Arts Night 2012 game exhibition    
This is really a prototype for a game where visitors are given the ability to create content for the game using some
more traditional means, in this case pen and paper.    
Visitors were given pen and paper to draw a track. The drawing was then scanned and added to the game. Unfortunately
the second member of the team fell ill as the deadline approached, and the critical part that would've quickly turned
the scanned drawings into valid tracks was never finished.
